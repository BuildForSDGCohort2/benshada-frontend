## About

The name of our solution is **benshada**.
Our solution provides African fashion owners and retailers a continental platform to operate as well as manage some of their operations, particularly order and delivery, all in a bid to grow their business by improving sales

## Why

The problem we set out to solve is that of
_**The need for African fashion to expand beyond the borders of just a single country or state or LGA**_.

## Usage

URL to deployed staging-app is below
[Benshada Staging App]()

<!-- TODO: Add link to Heroku staging app -->

## Setup

1. Clone repo `git clone https://github.com/BuildForSDGCohort2/benshada-frontend.git benshada`
2. Verify npm global installation by running `npm install npm -g`
3. Install dependencies by running `npm install` from the **benshada** directory/folder
4. Start app locally by running `npm run dev` from the **benshada** directory/folder

#### Hints

1. Get Started: `npm install`
2. Install additional dependencies: `npm install <dependency-name>`
3. Run tests: `npm run test`
4. Run tests in watch mode: `npm run test:watch`
5. Run tests with test coverage info: `npm run test:cover`
6. Check the codebase for proper syntax and formatting compliance: `npm run lint`
7. Check the codebase for lint and test errors: `npm run check`
8. Build app for deployment: `npm run build`
9. Run app from build: `npm start`
10. Run app in local dev mode: `npm run dev`.

- This first runs `npm run check` to check codebase for lint and test errors. If any are found, an npm error is thrown and the app exits with an error code
